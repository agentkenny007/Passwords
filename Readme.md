# Passwords

Do you really trust that your password manager is keeping your passwords safe?
----------

#### The Problem

There are many password managers on the market right now, all of which may or may not truly keep your passwords safe.

#### The Second Probelm

I don't yet know how to make an app using Ionic.

#### The Solution

As a programmer, in an effort to refrain from succumbing to the paranoia of being hacked due to the inadequate level of security of just any ol' run-of-the-mill password management app, it's probably best to just create your own. That way you know how your data is being stored, where it is being sent, who actually has access to it, etc.

Enter: Passwords. My own personal password management app created by me. But really I'm just trying to learn Java and Ionic using [this tutorial](https://www.airpair.com/ionic-framework/posts/ionic-firebase-password-manager).
